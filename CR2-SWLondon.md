Modelling for SW London with Crossrail 2
========================================
This uses CR2 via Balham, with best efforts guesses of interchange times.

A selection of interesting journeys is listed, together with calculated route options.
A key for station codes is at the end.
The route options are sorted, with the fastest first.
The excess over the fastest route option is listed in brackets.
If the fastest route is direct, then only limited alternatives are shown.
No alternative that takes over 15 minutes longer is shown.
The number of trains per hour (tph) is also shown.
