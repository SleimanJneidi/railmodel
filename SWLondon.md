Modelling for SW London without Crossrail 2
===========================================
This uses best efforts guesses of interchange times.

A selection of interesting journeys is listed, together with calculated route options.
A key for station codes is at the end.
The route options are sorted, with the fastest first.
The excess over the fastest route option is listed in brackets.
If the fastest route is direct, then only limited alternatives are shown.
No alternative that takes over 15 minutes longer is shown.
The number of trains per hour (tph) is also shown.

Station entry/exit times, buses and walking times are not included.
Walking may affect the faster route on occasion.

The 'effective time' adds some fudge factors to take into account low frequency start service and an additional penalty per interchange. It is intended to be used as a rough metric of what a more typical journey would be like (ie. a non-perfect one).
The 'total effective time' is the sum of all effective times modelled.
It is a reasonable proxy for the total enhancement provided by the scheme.
