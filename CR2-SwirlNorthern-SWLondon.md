Modelling for SW London with Crossrail 2 Swirl plus Northern Line extension
===========================================================================
This uses CR2 via Earlsfield based on the [Swirl plan](http://ukrail.blogspot.co.uk/2015/11/crossrail-2-swirl.html), with best efforts guesses of interchange times.
It then changes Chelsea to Battersea Power, and adds a Northern Line extension from Battersea Power to Balham with one intermediate stop.
Trains from Morden run via Battersea Power to the West End.
Trains from Balham run via Stockwell to the City.

A selection of interesting journeys is listed, together with calculated route options.
A key for station codes is at the end.
The route options are sorted, with the fastest first.
The excess over the fastest route option is listed in brackets.
If the fastest route is direct, then only limited alternatives are shown.
No alternative that takes over 15 minutes longer is shown.
The number of trains per hour (tph) is also shown.

Station entry/exit times, buses and walking times are not included.
Walking may affect the faster route on occasion, notably to Leicester Square, 
which is easily accessed from the new proposed Shaftesbury Avenue exit of CR2.

The 'effective time' comparison adds some fudge factors to take into account low frequency 
start service and an additional penalty per interchange. It is intended to be used as a rough metric 
of what a more typical journey would be like (ie. a non-perfect one).
The 'total effective time' is the sum of all effective times modelled.
It is a reasonable proxy for the total enhancement provided by the scheme.
